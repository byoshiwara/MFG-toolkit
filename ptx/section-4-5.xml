<subsection><title>1. Solve equations algebraically</title>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~3x^{1.05} = 18~</m>.  Round your answer to hundredths. </p></statement>
 
<solution><p>This is a power equation. We divide both sides by 3 to isolate the variable, then raise both sides to the reciprocal of the exponent.
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                (x^{1.05})^{1/1.05} \amp = 6^{1/1.05}\\
                x \amp = 5.51                
                \end{aligned}</me></p>
</solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~3(1.05)^x = 18~</m>.  Round your answer to hundredths. </p></statement>
 
<solution><p>This is an exponential equation. We divide both sides by 3, then take logarithms.
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                \log(1.05^x) \amp = \log 6  \amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the third log property.}}\\
                x \log 1.05\amp = \log 6\\
                x \amp \dfrac{\log 6}{\log 1.05} = 36.72                
                \end{aligned}</me></p>
</solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~9x^{3/5} = 36~</m>.  Round your answer to hundredths. </p></statement>
 
<solution><p>This is a power equation. We divide both sides by 9 to isolate the variable, then raise both sides to the reciprocal of the exponent.
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                (x^{3/5}^{5/3} \amp = 4^{5/3}\\
                x \amp = 10.08                
                \end{aligned}</me></p>
</solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~1.5(3^{x/5}) = 12~</m>.  Round your answer to hundredths. </p></statement>
 
<solution><p>This is an exponential equation. We divide both sides by 1.5, then take logarithms.
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                \log 3^{x/5} \amp = \log 8  \amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the third log property.}}\\
                \dfrac{x}{5} \log 3  \amp = \log 8\\
                x \amp \dfrac{5\log 8}{\log 3} = 9.46

<subsection><title>2. Calculate gowth and decay rates</title>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>The half-life of a cold medication in the body is 6 hours. Find its decay rate.</p></statement>

<solution><p>The decay law for the medication is <m>N=N_0(0.5)^{t/8}</m>. We can rewrite this expression as <m>N=N_0(0.5^{1/8})^t</m>, so <m>b=0.5^{1/8}=0.9170</m>, and <m>r=1-b=0.083</m>. The decay rate is 8.3%.</p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>The growth rate of a population of badgers is 3.8% per year. Find its doubling time.</p></statement>

<solution><p>The growth law for the population is <m>P=P_0(1.038)^t</m>. We set <m>P=2P_0</m> and solve for <m>t</m>.
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                2P_0 \amp = P_0(1.038)^t  \amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by}~P_0.}\\
                2 \amp = (1.038)^t  \amp\amp \blert{\text{Take the log of both sides.}}\\
                \log 2 \amp = t \log 1.038  \amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the third log property.}}\\
                t \amp = \dfrac{\log 2}{\log 1.038} = 18.59            
                \end{aligned}</me>
The doubling time is 18.59 years.</p></solution></example>

<subsubsection><title>Exercises</title>

<exercise><statement><p>The doubling time for a population is 18 years. Find its annual growth rate.</p></statement>
    <answer><p>3.9%</p></answer></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>A radioactive isotope decays by 0.04% per second.  What is its half-life?</p></statement>
    <answer><p>4.81 hrs</p></answer></exercise>

<subsection><title>3. Analyze graphs</title>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>The graph shows the population, <m>P</m>, of a herd of llamas <m>t</m> years after 2000.<ol label="a">
    <li>How many llamas were there in 2000?</li>
    <li>What is the doubling time for the population?</li>
    <li>What is the annual growth rate for the population?</li></ol></p>
    <sidebyside width="35%"><image source="images/fig-4-5-1.png"><description>graph</description></image></sidebyside>
</statement>
 
<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li> The initial value of the population is given by the <m>P</m>-intercept of the graph, <m>(0,15)</m>. There were 15 llamas in 2000.</li>
    <li>When <m>t=4,~P=30</m>, and when <m>t=8,~P=60</m>, so the llama population doubles every 4 years.</li>
    <li>The growth factor for the population is <m>2^{1/4}</m>  or 1.189, so the annual growth rate is 18.9%.</li></ol>
</p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Write a decay law for the graph shown below, where <m>t</m> is in hours and <m>N</m> is in milligrams.</p>
<sidebyside width="40%"><image source="images/fig-4-5-2.png"><description>graph</description></image></sidebyside>
</statement>

<solution><p>The initial value is given by the vertical intercept of the graph, <m>(0,600)</m>, so <m>N_0 = 600</m>.</p>  <p>When <m>t=5,~N=300</m>, so the half-life of the substance is 5 hours. Thus the decay law is <m>N(t)=600(0.5)^{t/5}</m>, or <m>N(t)=600(0.87)^t</m>.</p></solution></example>
